# Upload regalcare App to GitHub - iPad Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to **github.com** in Safari
2. Click **"+"** → **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: **"regalcare-app"**
4. Description: **"Comprehensive waste management system for regalcare bin valet services"**
5. Make it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
6. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we have our own)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Upload Files to GitHub

### Method A: Upload Archive File
1. In your new repo, click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. Upload the **regalcare-app.tar.gz** file from your downloads
3. GitHub will automatically extract it for you
4. Commit message: **"Initial regalcare app upload"**
5. Click **"Commit changes"**

### Method B: Upload Individual Files (if archive doesn't work)
Upload these files in this order:

**Core Files (upload first):**
- README.md
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- tsconfig.json
- vite.config.ts
- tailwind.config.ts
- postcss.config.js
- components.json
- drizzle.config.ts
- .gitignore

**Then create folders and upload:**
- Create folder: **client** → upload all client files
- Create folder: **server** → upload all server files  
- Create folder: **shared** → upload schema.ts

## Step 3: Verify Upload
After uploading, your repository should have:
```
